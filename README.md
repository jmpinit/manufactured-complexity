Algorithmic design for monochrome pixel art circuitry. Its generator is in the form of a web application.

## dependencies

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* Python 2.7

## generate

1. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies.
2. Run `gulp serve` to build project and run web server. Changes go live immediately.
3. Visit [newly launched local web server](http://localhost:2000) using a web browser (preferably Chrome).
4. Wait for randomly seeded design to appear.
